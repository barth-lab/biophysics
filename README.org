* biophysics
Library and tools for parsing and modifying biophysical files. 
* Usage
** Clone a Copy
   #+BEGIN_SRC
$ git clone https://github.com/glis-glis/biophysics.git
   #+END_SRC
** Compile Binaries
   #+BEGIN_SRC
$ ./install
   #+END_SRC
** Tools
   All tools are in the ~bin~ folder and the corresponding source file
   in the ~tools~ folder. Each tool has a help, which can be evoked
   by ~bin/script --help~
* Design Choices
** Do One Thing and Do It Well
   Each tool can only do one thing, but does it very fast. Tools can
   be piped together to achieve more complicated operations
** Data is Flat
   Even though a protein can be viewed as a tree (a protein consists
   of chains, a chain consists of residues, a residue consists of
   atoms), the internal representation is a flat table of atoms. This
   helps for data locality and makes lazy data easier.
** Lazy data
   Data is handled lazily, that is, it is only evaluated when needed,
   for example when printing.
